# --------------------------------------------------------------------

- Written and tested on Centos 7 (1708) default mininal and default Gnome install
- On a GNOME environment a terminal with the miner is launched automatically at the Desktop
- Desktop environments automatically login and launch miner; screen is locked for security automatically
- On headless environments, the miner is installed as a systemd service and is launched at boot
- Check status on headless environments by using `systemctl status centosEther`
- Display miner output on headless environment by using `journalctl -f -u centosEther`

## USAGE

Your computer will restart twice before launching the miner. If your on a fast computer this may happen before you even get a chance to log in. This is completely normal. 

`sudo chmod a+x ether.sh`

`sudo ./ether.sh --wallet 0xf1d9bb42932a0e770949ce6637a0d35e460816b5 --use-intel-desktop`

USAGE: ether.sh < --wallet | --use-intel-desktop | --use-intel-headless | --desktop | --headless | --help  >
                                                                                                                    
    --wallet              --->  ethereum wallet address to mine  e.g. "0xf1d9bb42932a0e770949ce6637a0d35e460816b5"
    --use-intel-desktop   --->  use intel video for display with GNOME desktop, Nvidia for mining; useful to eliminate lag
    --use-intel-headless  --->  use intel integrated video for display, Nvidia for mining; frees some resources
    --desktop             --->  use Nvidia for mining and display; will cause screen to lag a bit in GNOME
    --headless            --->  use Nvidia for mining and display
    --help                --->  display this menu
```

```
